/**
 * The fitted overview framing: the album cloud's percentile bounds
 * (state/bounds.ts getCloudBounds), their midpoint (cloudCenter), and the
 * zoom at which that box fits the frustum with margin (fitZoom). Written by
 * canvas/InitialFrame.tsx once per data load and again (without moving the
 * camera) on every sliderT change, since each slider stop has its own extent.
 *
 * This is the single published source of the fitted zoom. Consumers:
 * CameraRig (MIN_ZOOM = 0.8 * zoom), AlbumField (u_fitZoom), the
 * RegionLabels driver (label fade), AtlasManager (lazy-load gate),
 * CameraBounds (idle nudge box) and FlyToFocus (focus-release zoom).
 *
 * Plain module-level bridge, not Zustand state, mirroring state/invalidate.ts
 * and state/tooltipEl.ts: consumers read it synchronously inside wheel
 * handlers and per-frame closures, not through a React subscription.
 *
 * `TUNING.overviewZoom` is only the fallback before any MapData has loaded;
 * InitialFrame writes the real value in a layout effect, before the first
 * frame is drawn.
